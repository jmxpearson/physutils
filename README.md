## Physutils: Yet another Python library for electrophysiology

### Introduction:

The purpose of physutils is to collect together a useful set of classes and functions for analyzing extracellular neurophysiology data, namely, spikes and local field potentials.

Currently, 
    import physutils
imports all functions in `core` and the classes in `/classes/lfpclasses`.
